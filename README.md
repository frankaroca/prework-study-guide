# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This application was built to help me and others in our first steps as a web developers.

- My motivation for this project is have a quick access to all the information learned as a web developer, especially in my first year.
- As a student I felt the frustration and overwhelming situation about learn and retain all the information about all the topics.
- The main problem of memorazing all the information at once, having a quick acces to the information, tips or any important information about the topics learned.
- What I learned in this prework study project was the first steps into HTML, Git/Github, CSS and JavaScript, How to think as a developer and having a grown mindset.
